# [Dingemans Experiment](@id dingemans)

The Dingemans experiment provides a classic benchmark for validating dispersive shallow water models against experimental data. This experiment, conducted by Dingemans in 1994, simulates waves generated by a wave maker that propagate over a varying underwater topography (bathymetry).

## Experimental Setup

The experiment features waves with a small amplitude (A = 0.02) that encounter a trapezoidal bathymetry profile. The bottom topography starts flat, then rises to form an underwater "hill" before descending back to the original depth. This setup tests how well different dispersive wave models can capture the complex wave transformations that occur when waves interact with varying bottom topography.

The bathymetry profile consists of:

- A flat section from the wave maker to x = 11.01
- A linearly increasing slope from x = 11.01 to x = 23.04 (maximum height of 0.6)
- A flat plateau from x = 23.04 to x = 27.04  
- A linearly decreasing slope from x = 27.04 to x = 33.07
- A flat section beyond x = 33.07

This configuration allows researchers to study wave shoaling (changes in wave characteristics due to depth variations), which is crucial for understanding coastal wave dynamics.

## Numerical Simulation

Let's implement the Dingemans experiment and compare the performance of different dispersive shallow water models available in DispersiveShallowWater.jl.

First, we load the necessary packages:

```@example dingemans
using DispersiveShallowWater, OrdinaryDiffEqTsit5, Plots
```

Next, we set up the different equation systems we want to compare. Each represents a different level of approximation to the full water wave equations:

```@example dingemans
# BBM-BBM equations with variable bathymetry
bbm = BBMBBMEquations1D(bathymetry_type = bathymetry_variable,
                        gravity = 9.81, eta0 = 0.0)

# Svärd-Kalisch equations with specific parameter set
sk = SvaerdKalischEquations1D(gravity = 9.81, eta0 = 0.8, alpha = 0.0,
                              beta = 0.27946992481203003, gamma = 0.0521077694235589)

# Serre-Green-Naghdi equations with variable bathymetry  
sgn = SerreGreenNaghdiEquations1D(bathymetry_type = bathymetry_variable,
                                  gravity = 9.81)

# Hyperbolic approximation of Serre-Green-Naghdi equations
hysgn = HyperbolicSerreGreenNaghdiEquations1D(bathymetry_type = bathymetry_mild_slope,
                                              lambda = 500.0, gravity = 9.81)
```

The initial condition [`initial_condition_dingemans`](@ref) automatically sets up the trapezoidal bathymetry and initial wave field based on the dispersion relation of the Euler equations:

```@example dingemans
initial_condition = initial_condition_dingemans
boundary_conditions = boundary_condition_periodic
```

We create a computational domain that's large enough to contain the entire experimental setup, with the wave maker positioned appropriately:

```@example dingemans
coordinates_min = -138.0
coordinates_max = 46.0
N = 512
mesh = Mesh1D(coordinates_min, coordinates_max, N)
```

For the spatial discretization, we use fourth-order accurate summation-by-parts operators:

```@example dingemans
accuracy_order = 4
solver = Solver(mesh, accuracy_order)
```

We set up the time integration parameters. The experiment runs for a relatively long time (70 time units) to observe the full wave propagation and interaction with the bathymetry:

```@example dingemans
tspan = (0.0, 70.0)
saveat = range(tspan..., length = 500)
```

Now we create semidiscretizations for each equation system. Each semidiscretization bundles the mesh, equations, initial condition, solver, and boundary conditions:

```@example dingemans
semi_bbm = Semidiscretization(mesh, bbm, initial_condition, solver,
                              boundary_conditions = boundary_conditions)
semi_sk = Semidiscretization(mesh, sk, initial_condition, solver,
                             boundary_conditions = boundary_conditions)
semi_sgn = Semidiscretization(mesh, sgn, initial_condition, solver,
                              boundary_conditions = boundary_conditions)
semi_hysgn = Semidiscretization(mesh, hysgn, initial_condition, solver,
                                boundary_conditions = boundary_conditions)
```

We convert each semidiscretization to an ODE problem and solve using the Tsit5 time integrator:

```@example dingemans
ode_bbm = semidiscretize(semi_bbm, tspan)
ode_sk = semidiscretize(semi_sk, tspan)
ode_sgn = semidiscretize(semi_sgn, tspan)
ode_hysgn = semidiscretize(semi_hysgn, tspan)

sol_bbm = solve(ode_bbm, Tsit5(), abstol = 1e-7, reltol = 1e-7,
                save_everystep = false, saveat = saveat)
sol_sk = solve(ode_sk, Tsit5(), abstol = 1e-7, reltol = 1e-7,
               save_everystep = false, saveat = saveat)
sol_sgn = solve(ode_sgn, Tsit5(), abstol = 1e-7, reltol = 1e-7,
                save_everystep = false, saveat = saveat)
sol_hysgn = solve(ode_hysgn, Tsit5(), abstol = 1e-7, reltol = 1e-7,
                  save_everystep = false, saveat = saveat)
```

## Visualization and Comparison

For proper comparison, we need to account for the fact that the BBM-BBM equations use a different reference level (η₀ = 0) compared to the other equations. We create a custom conversion function to shift the BBM-BBM results:

```@example dingemans
# BBM-BBM equations need to be translated vertically for comparison
shifted_waterheight(q, equations) = waterheight_total(q, equations) + 0.8
DispersiveShallowWater.varnames(::typeof(shifted_waterheight), equations) = ("η",)
```

Finally, we create comparison plots at four different time instances to observe how the waves evolve as they interact with the bathymetry:

```@example dingemans
# Define simulation parameters
times = [14.0, 28.0, 42.0, 70.0]
y_limits = (-0.03, 0.87)

# Model configurations: (semidiscretization, solution, label, conversion_function)
models = [
    (semi_bbm, sol_bbm, "BBM", shifted_waterheight),
    (semi_sk, sol_sk, "Svärd-Kalisch", waterheight_total),
    (semi_sgn, sol_sgn, "Serre-Green-Naghdi", waterheight_total),
    (semi_hysgn, sol_hysgn, "Hyperbolic Serre-Green-Naghdi", waterheight_total)
]

# Create snapshot plots for each time
snapshot_plots = []
for time_val in times
    step_idx = argmin(abs.(saveat .- time_val))
    p = plot(title = "t = $time_val", ylims = y_limits)
    
    for (i, (semi, sol, label, conversion)) in enumerate(models)
        # Only show bathymetry on the last model to avoid clutter
        show_bathy = (i == length(models))
        
        plot!(p, semi => sol, 
              label = label,
              conversion = conversion,
              plot_bathymetry = show_bathy,
              step = step_idx,
              legend = false, suptitle = "Dingemans at t = $(time_val)", title = "")
    end
    
    push!(snapshot_plots, p)
end

# Create legend plot 
legend_plot = plot(legend=:top, framestyle = :none, legendfontsize = 11)

for (_, _, label, _) in models
    plot!(legend_plot, [], [], label = label)
end
plot!(legend_plot, [], [], label = "Bathymetry", color = :black)

# Combine all plots
all_plots = [snapshot_plots..., legend_plot]
plot(all_plots..., 
     size = (900, 800), 
     layout = @layout([a b; c d; e]),
)
savefig("dingemans_comparison.png") # hide

The results show how different dispersive wave models capture the wave evolution over the trapezoidal bathymetry. Key observations:

- **Wave transformation**: All models show the characteristic changes in wave amplitude and wavelength as waves encounter the changing depth
- **Model agreement**: The Svärd-Kalisch, Serre-Green-Naghdi, and Hyperbolic Serre-Green-Naghdi models show good agreement, indicating their similar level of physical accuracy
- **BBM-BBM behavior**: The BBM-BBM model captures the overall wave behavior well, though with some differences in fine details
- **Bathymetry effects**: The black line shows the underwater topography, clearly illustrating how the waves respond to depth changes

This comparison demonstrates the capability of DispersiveShallowWater.jl to simulate complex wave-bathymetry interactions and provides insight into the relative performance of different dispersive wave models for practical applications.
